## Installation

1. Install [VA Smalltalk 9.2.1 or newer](https://www.instantiations.com/products/vasmalltalk/download.html).
2. Install Tonel support in your development image following [this guide](https://github.com/vasmalltalk/tonel-vast#installation).
3. Clone this repository.
4. The easiest and recommended approach is to install it via a script:

```smalltalk
| loader path |
path := (CfsPath named: '<insert path to root sunit-extensions-vast local repo here>').
loader := TonelLoader readFromPath: path.
loader
	beUnattended; "do not prompt and use all defaults"
	useGitVersion.
loader loadAllMapsWithRequiredMaps.
```

Or you can load the Configuration Map `VastSUnitExtensions` from the context menu of the Configuration Maps Browser: `"Import"` -> `"Load Configuration Maps from Tonel repository..."` -> select path to root `sunit-extensions-vast` local repo. This will open a dialog and will use convenient defaults for the load. Refer to [its documentation](https://github.com/instantiations/tonel-vast#using-gui-menus) for more details.

5. Optionally run the SUnit tests included in the map `VastSUnitExtensions` to ensure correct installation. One easy way is to right-click on the `VastSUnitExtensions` map name in the Name pane (as opposed to version pane ) and then select `Test Loaded Applications`.

## Quick Start

This repository includes tests which also work as examples for users to get started. Check the application `VastSUnitExtensionsExamplesApp` and you will find examples such as `TestEtDictionaryInspector`, `TestEtTextComparisonBrowser`, `TestEtWorkspace`, etc.

Ultimately, all you need to do is to subclass `EtWindowsTestCase` or `UITestCase` and call their API from within your tests.
